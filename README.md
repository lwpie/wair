This repository contains the implementation associated with our academic paper. It is organized as follows:

1. **duckdb**: Modifications to DuckDB.
2. **dbgen**: TPC-H benchmark data generation.
3. **exec**: Workflow pipeline components and pseudo-distributed scripts for simplified execution.

For experiment results, please refer to the `logs` folder, which contains our experimental results and associated plotting scripts. The `legacy` folder provides an alternate pipeline with minimal modifications for debugging purposes, and it produces the same results.

If you have any questions or need further information, feel free to ask.
